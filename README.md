# DIREKTSPEED Server - PreRender

This is Forked from harp most and then got improved
- can be used as Supplyer of Middelware for Routing Request to the steal/prerender layout partial paradigm
- can be used as StandAlone Server via cli interface offered by binary "prerender"
- get used normal as a Option for DIREKTSPEED Server and is serving projects with the prerender option


> zero-configuration web server with built in pre-processing
> can be used with DIREKTSPEED Server as Module

### What is DIREKTSPEED Server -PreRender?

DIREKTSPEED Server is a static web server that also serves doT Jade, Markdown, EJS, Less, Stylus, Sass, and CoffeeScript **as** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any configuration. It supports the beloved layout/partial paradigm and it has flexible metadata and global objects for traversing the file system and injecting custom data into templates. Optionally, DIREKTSPEED Server - Module PreRender can also compile your project down to static assets for hosting behind any valid HTTP server.

### Why?

Pre-compilers are becoming extremely powerful and shipping front-ends as static assets has many upsides. It's simple, it's easy to maintain, it's low risk, easy to scale, and requires low cognitive overhead. I wanted a lightweight web server that was powerful enough for me to abandon web frameworks for dead simple front-end publishing.

### Features

- easy installation, easy to use
- fast and lightweight
- robust (clean urls, intelligent path redirects)
- built in pre-processing
- first-class layout and partial support
- built in LRU caching in production mode
- can export assets to HTML/CSS/JS
- does not require a build steps or grunt task
- fun to use

### Installation

    sudo npm install -g steal-srv-prerender

### Quick Start

Creating a new steal-srv-prerender application is a breeze...

    prerender init myproj
    prerender server myproj

Your DIREKTSPEED Server application is now running at [http://localhost:9000]()

---

## Documentation

DIREKTSPEED Server - Module PreRender can be used as a library or as a command line utility.

### CLI Usage

    Usage: prerender [command] [options]

    Commands:

      init [path]                 initalize new steal-srv-prerender application (defaults to current directory)
      server [path] [options]     start steal-srv-prerender server
      compile [path] [options]    compile project to static assets
      multihost [path] [options]  start steal-srv-prerender server to host directory of steal-srv-prerender apps

    Options:

      -h, --help     output usage information
      -V, --version  output the version number

Start the server in root of your application by running...

    prerender server

You may optionally supply a port to listen on...

    prerender server --port 8002

Compile an application from the root of your application by running...

    prerender compile

You may optionally pass in a path to where you want the compiled assets to go...

    prerender compile --output /path/to/cordova/project/www

### Lib Usage

You may also use prerender as a node library for compiling or running as a server.

Serve up a prerender application...

```js
var stealSrvPrerender = require("steal-srv-prerender")
stealSrvPrerender.server(projectPath [,args] [,callback])
```

**Or** compile steal-srv-prerender application

```js
var stealSrvPrerender = require("steal-srv-prerender")
stealSrvPrerender.compile(projectPath [,outputPath] [, callback])
```

**Or** use as Connect/ExpressJS middleware

```js
var express = require("express");
var stealSrvPrerender = require("steal-srv-prerender");
var app = express();
```

```js 
// Express 3
app.configure(function(){ 
  app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));
  app.use(stealSrvPrerender.mount(__dirname + "/public"));
});
```

```js 
// Express 4

app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));
app.use(stealSrvPrerender.mount(__dirname + "/public"));

```

# TODO: 
Make it extend able via npm install 
write a module loader for that
steal-prerender-donejs make use of steal/use
steal-prerender could offer a middelware to link all modules from
the path


function npmls(cb) {
  require('child_process').exec('npm ls --depth 0 --json', function(err, stdout, stderr) {
    if (err) return cb(err)
    cb(null, JSON.parse(stdout));
  });
}
npmls(console.log);


npm.commands.ls(args, [silent,] callback)
console.log(Object.keys(require('./package.json').dependencies));

we will probally use rootRequire try catched

2. The Global

In your app.js:

global.__base = __dirname + '/';
In your very/far/away/module.js:

var Article = require(__base + 'app/models/article');


---
7. The Wrapper

Courtesy of @a-ignatov-parc. Another simple solution which increases obviousness, simply wrap the require() function with one relative to the path of the application's entry point file.

Place this code in your app.js, again before any require() calls:

global.rootRequire = function(name) {
    return require(__dirname + '/' + name);
}
You can then require modules like this:

var Article = rootRequire('app/models/article');



------

Install some module:

npm install app-module-path --save
In your app.js, before any require() calls:

require('app-module-path').addPath(__dirname + '/app');


or Use NODE_PATH=. or project root for require

hacky method

process.env.NODE_PATH = __dirname;
require('module').Module._initPaths();

I've been using symlinks with the following structure:
```
/node_modules
/package.json
/src
  /node_modules
    /client -> ../client
    /server -> ../server
    /shared -> ../shared
  /client
    /apps
      /main
        /test
          main.spec.js
        index.js
    /modules
      /foo
        /test
          foo.spec.js
        index.js
  /server
    /apps
    /modules
  /shared
```
it also solves the problem of not know where the modules come from because all app modules have client/server/shared prefixes in require paths
